# Yozuk

## Introduction

Yozuk is an assistant bot designed for helping programmers with trivial tasks such as UUID generation, hash calculation and timestamp conversion.
Unlike normal command-line tools, Yozuk uses a simple NLP approach to infer the meaning of your requests, so you don't have to remember the exact syntax of commands.

## Getting Started

[Web App]({{< relref "/docs/app/web" >}}) is the easiest way to try Yozuk.

Yozuk provides a [Command Line App]({{< relref "/docs/app/cli" >}}) called `zuk`, if you prefer a terminal interface.

Also, chatbot integrations are available for [Telegram]({{< relref "/docs/app/telegram" >}}), [Slack]({{< relref "/docs/app/slack" >}}) and [Discord]({{< relref "/docs/app/discord" >}}).
