# Yozuk

## Introduction

Yozuk is an assistant bot designed for helping programmers with trivial tasks such as UUID generation, hash calculation and timestamp conversion.
Unlike normal command-line tools, Yozuk uses a simple NLP approach to infer the meaning of your requests, so you don't have to remember the exact syntax of commands.
