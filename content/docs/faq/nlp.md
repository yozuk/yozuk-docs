# Natural Language Processing

## Does Yozuk use AIaaS (Artificial Intelligence as a Service) such as Amazon Lex or Google Cloud NLP?

No, it doesn’t. Yozuk has the internal NLP engine.

## Does Yozuk learn from conversations with users?

No, it doesn’t. Yozuk does not save any data. The machine-learning process was done in the build step and Yozuk will never be affected by user inputs.
